Training images of invasive plants in size 224*224 for convolutional neural networks

Here are two folders containing 224 * 224 deep learning training images of Japanese barberry and multiflora rose. 

I've been studying how to use drone images and deep learning as a method to detect invasive plant species. 

I hope to add other invasive plant images to this collection soon.
